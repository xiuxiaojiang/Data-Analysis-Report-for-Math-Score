# Data-Analysis-Report-for-Math-Score

The U.S. News report indicates that the high school graduation rate for the 2018-2019 academic year was 88%, reaching the average rate compared to previous years. However, certain states, such as Arizona (75%), New Mexico (76%), and Washington DC (76%), have significantly lower graduation rates. A higher high school graduation rate is vital for both individuals and society, as it leads to better job prospects, higher wages, stronger work habits, and improved local economies.

This study aims to identify ways to support students in achieving better academic performance and graduating from high school. Specifically, it seeks to investigate potential differences in math scaled scores among first-grade students based on class sizes. The objective is to determine which class size is associated with the highest math scaled scores in the first grade.

By examining the impact of class size on academic achievement, this research aims to contribute to the development of effective strategies and policies that promote student success and increase high school graduation rates. Ultimately, the study seeks to help students thrive in school and successfully graduate, paving the way for brighter futures.
